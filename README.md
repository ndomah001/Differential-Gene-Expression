# Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis
## üìù Background
This project was inspired by [this study from ScienceSignaling](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.adf1947#sec-4) that identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) named LETS1, which amplifies the TGF-Œ≤ signaling pathway, known for driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression. LETS1 stabilizes the TGF-Œ≤ type I receptor (TŒ≤RI) by interacting with NFAT5, leading to the suppression of SMAD7, a protein that typically degrades TŒ≤RI. This creates a feedback loop that enhances TGF-Œ≤ signaling, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. LETS1's role was confirmed in breast and lung cancer cells, suggesting it may contribute to cancer metastasis in patients.

I then performed a differential gene expression analysis (in R using DESeq2) on the RNA-seq counts extracted from [NCBI GEO (Gene Experssion Omnibus) - GSE203119](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE203119). 

## üìä Visualizations
### Dispersion Estimates
Visualize the variability of gene expression across samples.

### Histogram of p-values
The peak near 0 indicates a high number of differentially expressed genes.

### Volcano Plot
Visualize the relationship between the magnitude of change (log fold change) and statistical significance (p-value) of genes, as well as up- and down-regulation.
